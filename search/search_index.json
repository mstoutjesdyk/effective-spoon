These pages are created to help users navigate UltraScan and get the best out of this software. Each section is listed below with a quick description of what each subsection module does. The individual pages on each module are linked and provide a detailed explaination through how to use them. The most commonly used modules will be in red text. Edit Edit Data All experimental data aquired with the AUC requires pre-processing. This module creates an edit profile of the data. A user can create multiple edit profiles, and each profile receives a unique name. UltraScan assists in the process by handling the most essential diagnosics and editing steps automatically, but the user can intervene when necessary. Preferences This module contains a number of parameters that can be set to customize UltraScan according to personal preferences. This include directory paths, font and colour preferences, database preferences, and master password. Velocity Enhanced van Holde-Weischet This module differentiates boundary spreading due to diffusion from the boundary spreading due to the heterogeneity in sedimentation coefficients. Use this analysis technqiue using the fit generated by the final 2DSA refinement model. Then use Combine Distributions Plots (vHW) to view the boundary fraction as a function of sedimentation coefficient. Custom 2-D Grid Control This module enables you to edit custom 2-D initialization grids for the 2DSA. 2-D Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a 2DSA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Paramertically Constrained Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a PSCA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Initialize Genetic Algorithm This genetic algorithm program will generate solute distribution data. The output data is required in order to perform a genetic algorithm analysis on the UltraScan LIMS database. Initialize Discrete Model Genetic Algorithm Second Moment This module is used to calculate the weight-average sedimentation coefficeints for each scan included in an analysis by finding the second moment point of the boundary. Time Derivative This module allows you to determine the initial range of the sedimentation coefficient. FE Model Viewer This module is used to import, display, and export finite element solutions fitted to velocity experiments by various methods. It will import models from finite element fitting sessions, 2DSA fitts, genetic algorithm fits, or C(s) fits. It will then compare the fitted model to the experimental data, and display residual plots, sedimentation and diffusion coefficient distributions, as well as molecular weight distributions. These models can be displayed as a 3-D plot showing partial concentrations on a 2-D grid of any of the two folllowing parameters: \\(s\\) , \\(D\\) , \\(f/f_{0}\\) , and MW. The residual plot includes deconvoluted time- and radially- invariant noise plots. All results can be saved. FE Model Statistics This module allows you to obtain statistics for a model computed by any finite element analysis modeule in UltraScan. The following metrics are supported: three distribuion limits, $D_{i}%; span computed from the distribution limits; concentration integral between the lowest and highest distribution limit; maximum and minimum X-value of the distribution; mean, mode, and median of the distribution, and; skew and kurtosis of the distribution. View Pseudo 3-D Distributions Using this module, you may display solution distribution data in a pseudo-3-D form where the Z-axis is simulated using colors in a color map. Data from different cells can be combined. Speed Ramp Analysis Utilities Data Aquisition Import Experimental Data Here you can import and convert experimental raw data into a set of files written in the UltraScan III OpenAUC format. This file is a binary file containing all the information from a single dataset or tripe (cell/channel/wavelength). Export openAUC Data FDS File Manager This module allos you to manage the scan files created by the AOS Fluorescence Detector data aquisitin software. Fit Meniscus This module allows you to modify an edited data set's meniscus value based on meniscus-fit models. A polynomial fit to a set of meniscus-RMSD points is plotted and its low point presented as the default new meniscus value. That value - or a manually modified one - can then replace the value in the associated Edited data set. The model with closest meniscus value in the set of fit-meniscus models that were obtained by a front-end or back-end meniscus fit 2DSA run can be preserved, while all other models in the set (and any associated noises) are removed. Spectral Analysis Color Gradient Generator Report Generator Rotor Calibration License Manager Combine Distribution Plots (vHW) This module combines integral van Holde-Weischet G(s) distributions from multiple datasets, allowing you to compare integral distributions from different cells to each other. It is useful when you want to analyze the same sample under different conditions (for example, different pH levels, or different concentrations). All distributions are plotted relative to the boundary fraction used in analysis. Combine Discrete Distributions This module combines model distributions from multiple datasets, allowing you to compare bar plots of distributions from different cells to each other. Distribution plots present relative concentration (Y) for X, which may be the sedimentation coefficient, molecular weight, diffusion coefficient, frictional ratio, or partial specific density. Combine Integral Distributions Create Global Model This module combines models into a single global model that can be used in global fits. Most commonly, this module is used to form an input to the Initialize Genetic Algorithm program in which a global set of buckets may be created for use in a global fit Genetic Algorithm run. View Raw CFA Data View Raw Optima Data View Time State Density Matching Pseudo-Absorbance Multiwavelength View Multiwavelength Data View MWL Spectral MWL Species Fit Optima MWL Fit Simulation Simulation Finite Element Simulation This module is used to simulate an exxperiment using ASTFEM or ASTFVM methods.

Manage Associations This button brings up a Model Associations Dialog in which the model associations and their properties can be specified. Model Associations Dialog In this dialog, you can define reversible associations of model components. Associations are constructed in terms of chemical equations with one or two analytes on one side and a product on the other. Each association row is built by dragging a model component in the upper list to an Analyte or Product cell.As each analyte is dropped, its code letter (A, B, C, ...) appears in the cell with a subscript that represents the oligomer number of the molecule. At least one Analyte and one Product cell must be thus populated. The implied chemical equation must be balanced by setting the stoichiometry counter in each cell such that stoichiometry times oligomer value(s) on the left equals the product of stoichiometry and oligomer on the right. K_association and K_off Rate values should be entered for each row.

Import Experimental Data 2. Edit Data 3. Time Derivative Analysis This step will provide an range for the sedimentation coefficient for use in the upcoming analysis steps. Open Velocity: Time Derivative and select Load Experiment to load the experimental data. Adjust analysis controls: Set Data Smoothing to ~ 10. Set Boundary Pos (%) to 0. Create an Exclusion Profile for scans that do not exhibit a stable upper plateau. Select Average S to plot the dc/dt S-value distribution (default setting). Adjust S-value cutoff as needed. The correct S limits to choose are the left and right limits of the S-value distribution where all signal returns to baseline. The minimum S-value allowed is 0.2 S. 4. 2DSA: Fit Time Invariant Noise This step can be done locally on UltraScan's 2DSA module, but the following assumes the use of the USLIMS site. Log into the US3 LIMS portal and navigate to Analysis: Queue Setup. Load the Dataset. Setup 2DSA Control a. Set the \\(s\\) -value Limits from the range obtained in Step 3. b. Set \\(f/f_{0}\\) Limits to 1-4 or adjust the upper limit based on prior knowledge of the sample. c. Set the Resolution. The default for both \\(s\\) and \\(f/f_{0}\\) is 64. The resolution is the number of points into which this variable will be discretized. For example, if the range is selected from 1-5, and the resolution is set to 40, there will be 10 grid points/ \\(s\\) -value, resulting in an increment of 0.1 S. d. Set the Grid Resolution. The default resolution of 64 will be sufficient for most situations. When you have a very poly-disperse or heterogeneous sample you may have to go higher. Larger values will increase compute time. A good strategy is to check if there are noticeable jumps in the fit. If there are, increase the resolution. If you are trying to fit a bi- or tri-modal system, you may be able to get a higher resolution by using the custom grid method, and use the appropriate resolution for each grid. e. Select Fit Time Invariant Noise. f. Leave all other settings at default values. Submit the Job to your desired cluster. Check Queue Viewer for job completion. Open Velocity: FE Model Viewer to confirm the results. Load the Dataset of the newly generated time invariant noise file. The file will be of the format \"2DSA.run_name\". Remember to Save Results. If random residuals are obtained, proceed with step 5, but if residuals do not look random, and a strong diagonal line in the residual bitmap is apparent, investigate range settings for S and f/f0 settings and repeat 2DSA with improved ranges. Note: Do not set the lower s-value limit too low, as this could create artificially low-s species signal if a baseline or slowly changing baseline exists. These artifacts are better handled in the time invariant noise. 5. 2DSA: Fit Meniscus, TI Noise, RI Noise Log into the US3 LIMS portal and navigate to Analysis: Queue Setup to Load the Dataset. By default, it will load the dataset that was saved from the previous step. Setup 2DSA Control a. Set the \\(s\\) -value and \\(f/f_{0}\\) Limits. Use the same range settings as in Step 4. b. Set the Resolution and Set the Grid Resolution. c. Select Fit Time Invariant Noise and Fit Radially Invariant Noise, d. Select Fit Meniscus . The fitting should occur over 0.03 cm with 10 points. Submit the Job to your desired cluster. Check Queue Viewer for job completion. Open Utilities: Fit Meniscus. Click on Scan Database (if using the database) and check the status line for new results.

Check Queue Viewer for job completion. Open Velocity: FE Model Viewer to confirm the results. Load the Dataset by selecting the file of the format \"2DSA.IT.run_name\". Remember to Save Results. All subsequent analyses methods should now be based on the model generated in this final 2DSA refinement step. At this point, multiple analysis options exist depending on the properties of the analyte distribution. If a paucidisperse solution is obtained, parsimonious regularization with the genetic algorithm method is appropriate. Otherwise, the data should be analyzed only by the 2DSA analysis in conjunction with a 50-iteration Monte Carlo analysis. Both options are explained below. 7.

Set \\(f/f_{0}\\) Limits to 1-4 or adjust the upper limit based on prior knowledge of the sample. c. Set the Resolution. The default for both \\(s\\) and \\(f/f_{0}\\) is 64. The resolution is the number of points into which this variable will be discretized. For example, if the range is selected from 1-5, and the resolution is set to 40, there will be 10 grid points/ \\(s\\) -value, resulting in an increment of 0.1 S. d. Set the Grid Resolution. The default resolution of 64 will be sufficient for most situations. When you have a very poly-disperse or heterogeneous sample you may have to go higher. Larger values will increase compute time. A good strategy is to check if there are noticeable jumps in the fit. If there are, increase the resolution. If you are trying to fit a bi- or tri-modal system, you may be able to get a higher resolution by using the custom grid method, and use the appropriate resolution for each grid. e.

The software features an integrated data editing and analysis environment with a portable graphical user interface. UltraScan provides the highest possible resolution for sedimentation velocity experiments using high-performance computing modules for 2-dimensional spectrum analysis, genetic algorithm, and for Monte Carlo analysis. A MySQL database backend is integrated for data management, and the UltraScan LIMS system provides web-based access to the database and supercomputing functionality. Supercomputing resources are provided through a NSF Teragrid Science Gateway. Special care has been taken in the design of the software to guarantee an optimum in flexibility, user-friendliness, stability and convenience. The software is written in C++. The software features popular sedimentation velocity and equilibrium analysis methods as well as simulation modules, utilities, and editing modules with support for velocity and equilibrium experiments, single and multi-channel centerpieces, absorbance and interference optics. All analysis methods generate ASCII formatted data suitable for import into third-party plotting programs, and contains a built-in postscript printer engine to generate publication - quality graphical representations of analysis data. UltraScan is offered in two versions, UltraScan-II and UltraScan-III. The latter is a complete rewrite of the former, with many new features and a greatly improved interface. UltraScan-III was released in the summer of 2011 and will eventually replace the older version. We will maintain UltraScan-II to assure access to legacy data because UltraScan-III is not backward compatible with UltraScan-II. New users are encouraged to switch to UltraScan-III. In addition to numerous interface changes, the most important changes in UltraScan-III are listed below: UltraScan-III adheres to the OpenAUC standard. Can be used simultaneously in a local disk-only mode without the requirement for network connectivity, or fully integrated with network capability, including a database and supercomputing backend Contains a local 2DSA that is multi-threaded to take advantage of multi-core technology All hydrodynamic models are represented in a single, generalized and standard structure that can be interpreted by the ASTFEM simulator and understood throughout the program.

These pages are created to help users navigate UltraScan and get the best out of this software. Each section is listed below with a quick description of what each subsection module does. The individual pages on each module are linked and provide a detailed explaination through how to use them. The most commonly used modules will be in red text. Edit Edit Data All experimental data aquired with the AUC requires pre-processing. This module creates an edit profile of the data. A user can create multiple edit profiles, and each profile receives a unique name. UltraScan assists in the process by handling the most essential diagnosics and editing steps automatically, but the user can intervene when necessary. Preferences This module contains a number of parameters that can be set to customize UltraScan according to personal preferences. This include directory paths, font and colour preferences, database preferences, and master password. Velocity Enhanced van Holde-Weischet This module differentiates boundary spreading due to diffusion from the boundary spreading due to the heterogeneity in sedimentation coefficients. Use this analysis technqiue using the fit generated by the final 2DSA refinement model. Then use Combine Distributions Plots (vHW) to view the boundary fraction as a function of sedimentation coefficient. Custom 2-D Grid Control This module enables you to edit custom 2-D initialization grids for the 2DSA. 2-D Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a 2DSA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Paramertically Constrained Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a PSCA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Initialize Genetic Algorithm This genetic algorithm program will generate solute distribution data. The output data is required in order to perform a genetic algorithm analysis on the UltraScan LIMS database. Initialize Discrete Model Genetic Algorithm Second Moment This module is used to calculate the weight-average sedimentation coefficeints for each scan included in an analysis by finding the second moment point of the boundary. Time Derivative This module allows you to determine the initial range of the sedimentation coefficient. FE Model Viewer This module is used to import, display, and export finite element solutions fitted to velocity experiments by various methods. It will import models from finite element fitting sessions, 2DSA fitts, genetic algorithm fits, or C(s) fits. It will then compare the fitted model to the experimental data, and display residual plots, sedimentation and diffusion coefficient distributions, as well as molecular weight distributions. These models can be displayed as a 3-D plot showing partial concentrations on a 2-D grid of any of the two folllowing parameters: \\(s\\) , \\(D\\) , \\(f/f_{0}\\) , and MW. The residual plot includes deconvoluted time- and radially- invariant noise plots. All results can be saved. FE Model Statistics This module allows you to obtain statistics for a model computed by any finite element analysis modeule in UltraScan. The following metrics are supported: three distribuion limits, $D_{i}%; span computed from the distribution limits; concentration integral between the lowest and highest distribution limit; maximum and minimum X-value of the distribution; mean, mode, and median of the distribution, and; skew and kurtosis of the distribution. View Pseudo 3-D Distributions Using this module, you may display solution distribution data in a pseudo-3-D form where the Z-axis is simulated using colors in a color map. Data from different cells can be combined. Speed Ramp Analysis Utilities Data Aquisition Import Experimental Data Here you can import and convert experimental raw data into a set of files written in the UltraScan III OpenAUC format. This file is a binary file containing all the information from a single dataset or tripe (cell/channel/wavelength). Export openAUC Data FDS File Manager This module allos you to manage the scan files created by the AOS Fluorescence Detector data aquisitin software. Fit Meniscus This module allows you to modify an edited data set's meniscus value based on meniscus-fit models. A polynomial fit to a set of meniscus-RMSD points is plotted and its low point presented as the default new meniscus value. That value - or a manually modified one - can then replace the value in the associated Edited data set. The model with closest meniscus value in the set of fit-meniscus models that were obtained by a front-end or back-end meniscus fit 2DSA run can be preserved, while all other models in the set (and any associated noises) are removed. Spectral Analysis Color Gradient Generator Report Generator Rotor Calibration License Manager Combine Distribution Plots (vHW) This module combines integral van Holde-Weischet G(s) distributions from multiple datasets, allowing you to compare integral distributions from different cells to each other. It is useful when you want to analyze the same sample under different conditions (for example, different pH levels, or different concentrations). All distributions are plotted relative to the boundary fraction used in analysis. Combine Discrete Distributions This module combines model distributions from multiple datasets, allowing you to compare bar plots of distributions from different cells to each other. Distribution plots present relative concentration (Y) for X, which may be the sedimentation coefficient, molecular weight, diffusion coefficient, frictional ratio, or partial specific density. Combine Integral Distributions Create Global Model This module combines models into a single global model that can be used in global fits. Most commonly, this module is used to form an input to the Initialize Genetic Algorithm program in which a global set of buckets may be created for use in a global fit Genetic Algorithm run. View Raw CFA Data View Raw Optima Data View Time State Density Matching Pseudo-Absorbance Multiwavelength View Multiwavelength Data View MWL Spectral MWL Species Fit Optima MWL Fit Simulation Simulation Finite Element Simulation This module is used to simulate an exxperiment using ASTFEM or ASTFVM methods.

This include directory paths, font and colour preferences, database preferences, and master password.","title":"Edit"},{"location":"us-overview/#velocity","text":"Enhanced van Holde-Weischet This module differentiates boundary spreading due to diffusion from the boundary spreading due to the heterogeneity in sedimentation coefficients. Use this analysis technqiue using the fit generated by the final 2DSA refinement model. Then use Combine Distributions Plots (vHW) to view the boundary fraction as a function of sedimentation coefficient. Custom 2-D Grid Control This module enables you to edit custom 2-D initialization grids for the 2DSA. 2-D Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a 2DSA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Paramertically Constrained Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a PSCA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Initialize Genetic Algorithm This genetic algorithm program will generate solute distribution data. The output data is required in order to perform a genetic algorithm analysis on the UltraScan LIMS database. Initialize Discrete Model Genetic Algorithm Second Moment This module is used to calculate the weight-average sedimentation coefficeints for each scan included in an analysis by finding the second moment point of the boundary. Time Derivative This module allows you to determine the initial range of the sedimentation coefficient. FE Model Viewer This module is used to import, display, and export finite element solutions fitted to velocity experiments by various methods. It will import models from finite element fitting sessions, 2DSA fitts, genetic algorithm fits, or C(s) fits. It will then compare the fitted model to the experimental data, and display residual plots, sedimentation and diffusion coefficient distributions, as well as molecular weight distributions. These models can be displayed as a 3-D plot showing partial concentrations on a 2-D grid of any of the two folllowing parameters: \\(s\\) , \\(D\\) , \\(f/f_{0}\\) , and MW. The residual plot includes deconvoluted time- and radially- invariant noise plots. All results can be saved. FE Model Statistics This module allows you to obtain statistics for a model computed by any finite element analysis modeule in UltraScan. The following metrics are supported: three distribuion limits, $D_{i}%; span computed from the distribution limits; concentration integral between the lowest and highest distribution limit; maximum and minimum X-value of the distribution; mean, mode, and median of the distribution, and; skew and kurtosis of the distribution. View Pseudo 3-D Distributions Using this module, you may display solution distribution data in a pseudo-3-D form where the Z-axis is simulated using colors in a color map.

Export openAUC Data FDS File Manager This module allos you to manage the scan files created by the AOS Fluorescence Detector data aquisitin software. Fit Meniscus This module allows you to modify an edited data set's meniscus value based on meniscus-fit models. A polynomial fit to a set of meniscus-RMSD points is plotted and its low point presented as the default new meniscus value. That value - or a manually modified one - can then replace the value in the associated Edited data set. The model with closest meniscus value in the set of fit-meniscus models that were obtained by a front-end or back-end meniscus fit 2DSA run can be preserved, while all other models in the set (and any associated noises) are removed. Spectral Analysis Color Gradient Generator Report Generator Rotor Calibration License Manager Combine Distribution Plots (vHW) This module combines integral van Holde-Weischet G(s) distributions from multiple datasets, allowing you to compare integral distributions from different cells to each other. It is useful when you want to analyze the same sample under different conditions (for example, different pH levels, or different concentrations). All distributions are plotted relative to the boundary fraction used in analysis. Combine Discrete Distributions This module combines model distributions from multiple datasets, allowing you to compare bar plots of distributions from different cells to each other. Distribution plots present relative concentration (Y) for X, which may be the sedimentation coefficient, molecular weight, diffusion coefficient, frictional ratio, or partial specific density.

The advantage of this method is its ability to nicely subtract out time invariant noise. Unlike the van Holde-Weischet module , the Time Derivative method does not correct for diffusion. In order to obtain accurate results, it is important to use only a small scan range over which diffusion has not change significantly. Time Derivative (dC/dt).
