PLoS ONE . https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126420 Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are a set of operating and instrument standards which dictate a processes control requirements and documentation. GMP environments provide assurances to the consumer and any regulatory agencies that: a. best practices were followed; b. results are validated, and can be audited; c. quality standards are observed, and; d. any risks are minimized throughout the procedure. GMP Obstacles in AUC Within the AUC lab, there are several issues that can be determined which affect the authenticity of data analysis procedures. Human error can be found in the form of the manual process of sample handling and AUC cell loading. There is a certain dexterity that is required to achieve reproducible loading volumes, as well as proper alignment of cells in the rotor. While the AUC is a highly sophisticated instrument, it comes with a large number of operational variable, which would need individual validation, before their effect on results can be minimized. There is weakness in the chain of data custody. This impairs the audit trail, and can allow for potential manipulation/falsification of primary research data. For example, the traditional data acquisition software is disconnected from the analysis process, and thus requires manual data transfer between multiple computers. Traditional data acquisition is performed on undocumented software. This software is often closed-source freeware, preventing any source code auditing, leaving no assurances for the users that the software follows any stringent GMP documentation requirements. Important parameters are not routinely checked for consistency. Resolution information content is affected by: number of scans in the experiment, duration of experiment, loading volume, and column length. Loading concentration can affect the mass action of reversible systems and non-ideality parameters. Chromatic aberration can cause incorrect radial reporting when recording wavelengths. Data quality is not checked for consistency. Data editing, analysis algorithms, and analysis parameters can be left up to an user to change at will. Data interpretation is affected by analysis parameters (grid size, grid resolution, edited data ranges, buffer corrections) and hardware parameters (rotor stretch corrections). Reporting is not an automated process. The processing of data is manual and based on a subjective interpretation of results. That interpretation does not necessarily include standard metrics for comparison that can be automated and applied without user bias. Hardware Effects A recent multi-labratory study demonstrated the importance of accurate reference materials to provide improved validation for the AUC. 1 Accurate reference materials are also useful in that they will complement the resolution gains offered by modern analysis software. The following hardware components of the AUC instrument have been found to affect analysis results. Rotor Speed Record Temperature and Centrifugal Force Integrals Radial Calibrations Temperature Optics: Light Intensity, Alignment, Force Integrals Chromatic Aberration While investigating the accuracy of radial recordings made on the Optima AUC, it was noted that there was the presence of wavelength dependence on the radial positions collected as a result of chromatic aberration, a phenomenon related to the variability of refraction at different wavelengths. Stretching or Contracting of the Rotor in Response to Speed Changes What is rotor stretching and how do we know it is occuring? We noticed that the Lamm Equation was being solved with incorrect boundary conditions. Typically, we expect the bottom of the cell to be routinely held constant at the known position at rest. However, the absolute radial position of the sample cell was shifting. Finite element solutions of the Lamm Equation require accurate knowledge of the boundary consitions, which include the radial positions of the meniscus and bottom location ofthe sample cell. Any error in these boundary conditions, or the absolute radial positionscollected will affect the fitte values of the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients. This error propogates to the calculations of biomolecular attributes. Stretching or contracting of the rotor changes these boundary conditions, and thus must be known. Specifically, the titanium rotors, when spun at very high speeds, were stretching a finite amount, changing the boundary conditions of the experiment compared to those at rest or a different speed. Consider the figure to the right: this is a temperture-time graph for a rotor spinning from rest to 60,000 RPM, resting for 15 mins, and then decelerating back down to rest. Notice how there is a temperature decrease intially as the rotor accelerates; the acceleration period takes ~5 minutes. As the speed increases the rotor needs energy to stretch out and so it takes it from its environment. The chamber will notice this change and correct the temperature to the stated temperature. This correction occurs while to rotor spins at 60,000 RPM for 15 minutes. After this time has elapsed, the rotor spins down to rest and no longer needs the heat energy it took from the environment and so it releases it, causing an increases in temperature. Again, the chamber will correct for this change. The valley and peak have approximately the same area, and this change in temperature is adiabatic.

Pearson, Coelfen. 2019. MWL Detector Calibration Alignment Test and Calibrations Angle Calibration: ensures the sliding stage scanning vector is aligned with the radial vector of the rotor. An angular scan of an empty sample cell is taken at radial positions near the top and bottom of the cell at 3,000 RPM. Map the angular position of the sample and reference sector positions. The difference between the top and bottom angles should be less than 0.25-degrees. If the angle is greater, the detector arm may be rotated until the result is satisfactory. This calibration is executed to determine the synchronization timing of the flash lamp for all possible rotor speeds. The cell sector angular position is selected for scans at incremental rotor speed settings in the calibration routine, and the results are fitted to a linear function internally in the software. Radial Calibration: scans the radial dimension of the counterbaance while the rotor is at a low speed such as 3,000 RPM. The edges of the counterbalance mask, on the reference sector side, are set to be 5.85 mm and 7.15 mm while int he rotor. These edges serve as reference points from which a radial calibration conversio of the stepper motor increments are generated. Final Checks Note that the fiber optic coupling to the flash lamp can affect the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, which can be explained by the non-uniformity in the arc generated across the electrodes of the flash lamp. To find the position of highest SNR, observe the noise structure of the recorded signal while adjusting the coupling of the fiber optical cable to the flash lamp. Additionally, the DC supply voltage to the flash lamps can influence the noise of the lamps, but the recent 20 W L12745 Xenon flash lamp from Hamamatsu provides significantly reduced signal noise. To assume optimal data quality, collect test scans of the system prior to expereimentation. A sharp meniscus and steep counterbaance edges in test scans are indicative of good alignment and focus. The most revealing test of data quality is to perform an experiment on well-characterized samples such as BSA. Using the 2DSA model in UltraScan provides particularly sensitive indications of data quality over relavent spectral ranges, and the evaulation of BSA should yeild S-Spectra of sharp monomer, dimer, and trimer peaks.","title":"Mwl optics"},{"location":"mwl-optics/#mwl-detector-calibration","text":"Alignment Test and Calibrations Angle Calibration: ensures the sliding stage scanning vector is aligned with the radial vector of the rotor.

These pages are created to help users navigate UltraScan and get the best out of this software. Each section is listed below with a quick description of what each subsection module does. The individual pages on each module are linked and provide a detailed explaination through how to use them. The most commonly used modules will be in red text. Edit Edit Data All experimental data aquired with the AUC requires pre-processing. This module creates an edit profile of the data. A user can create multiple edit profiles, and each profile receives a unique name. UltraScan assists in the process by handling the most essential diagnosics and editing steps automatically, but the user can intervene when necessary. Preferences This module contains a number of parameters that can be set to customize UltraScan according to personal preferences. This include directory paths, font and colour preferences, database preferences, and master password. Velocity Enhanced van Holde-Weischet This module differentiates boundary spreading due to diffusion from the boundary spreading due to the heterogeneity in sedimentation coefficients. Use this analysis technqiue using the fit generated by the final 2DSA refinement model. Then use Combine Distributions Plots (vHW) to view the boundary fraction as a function of sedimentation coefficient. Custom 2-D Grid Control This module enables you to edit custom 2-D initialization grids for the 2DSA. 2-D Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a 2DSA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Paramertically Constrained Spectrum Analysis This module enables you to perfrom a PSCA on a chosen experimental data set. Upon completion of an analysis fit, the following avaliable plots include: experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invarient noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-D model. Initialize Genetic Algorithm This genetic algorithm program will generate solute distribution data. The output data is required in order to perform a genetic algorithm analysis on the UltraScan LIMS database. Initialize Discrete Model Genetic Algorithm Second Moment This module is used to calculate the weight-average sedimentation coefficeints for each scan included in an analysis by finding the second moment point of the boundary. Time Derivative This module allows you to determine the initial range of the sedimentation coefficient. FE Model Viewer This module is used to import, display, and export finite element solutions fitted to velocity experiments by various methods. It will import models from finite element fitting sessions, 2DSA fitts, genetic algorithm fits, or C(s) fits. It will then compare the fitted model to the experimental data, and display residual plots, sedimentation and diffusion coefficient distributions, as well as molecular weight distributions. These models can be displayed as a 3-D plot showing partial concentrations on a 2-D grid of any of the two folllowing parameters: \\(s\\) , \\(D\\) , \\(f/f_{0}\\) , and MW. The residual plot includes deconvoluted time- and radially- invariant noise plots. All results can be saved. FE Model Statistics This module allows you to obtain statistics for a model computed by any finite element analysis modeule in UltraScan. The following metrics are supported: three distribuion limits, $D_{i}%; span computed from the distribution limits; concentration integral between the lowest and highest distribution limit; maximum and minimum X-value of the distribution; mean, mode, and median of the distribution, and; skew and kurtosis of the distribution.

An error region should be defined that usually ranges from +/- 10% of the oligomeric size. Show Final Grid This checkbox allows you to view the final grid. In this mode, it is not possible to make any further changes to the final grid or add new grids, but it is possible to change the view from sedimentation to molecular weight, or vise-versa.. It is also possible to delete partial grids. Show Sub-grids This checkbox allows you to view the layout of the sub-grids that will be used in the 2DSA. The 2DSA uses a scheme by which each grid is broken down into several sub-grids, each of which is analyzed independently on different processors, and the results are merged into a final grid. Each sub-grid should be small enough to fit into the computer memory of the analysis program. The sub-grid must also cover the parameter space evenly, and does not exclude major regions of the search space.

Rectangular grids can be defined in both the sedimentation and molecular weight domain, as well as frictional ratio and partial specific volume domains. Each grid can be re-displayed in the other domains. It is also possible to define multiple grid regions and combine them into a single grid which defines multiple solute regions. Each partial grid can be defined with a different frictional ratio range, molecular weight, or sedimentation coefficient range. Each grid can also be defined with a different partial specific volume. If you wish to define the grid to contain both sedimenting and floating species, you will need to define a fixed frictional ratio. However, you may have variations in the partial specific volume, to account for the difference in buoyancy while maintaining a positive molecular weight. All combined partial grids can be saved as a special model structure that can be stored in the database or on a disk to be submitted with either the desktop or supercomputing version of the 2DSA.

Upon completion of an analysis fit, plots available include: model lines; experiment; simulation; overlayed experiment and simulation; residuals; time-invariant noise; radially-invariant noise; 3-d model. Final outputs may include a model and computed noises. The PCSA method is used for composition analysis of sedimentation velocity experiments. It can generate sedimentation coefficient, diffusion coefficient, frictional coefficient, f/f0 ratio, and molecular weight distributions. The distributions can be plotted as 3-dimensional plots (2 parameters from the above list against each other), with the third dimension representing the concentration of the solute found in the composition analysis. The set of all such final calculated solutes form a model which is used to generate a simulation via Lamm equations. The simulation is plotted overlaying a plot of experimental data. The PCSA pass proceeds for a set of models each of which consists of the solute points along a curve in s,f/f0 space. The model whose RMSD of the resulting residuals (simulation-experimental difference) is the lowest forms the starting point for a second phase which uses Levenberg-Marquardt to refine the model to a final output model.

PCSA Fit Control The parameters of this dialog define and control an analysis run to find the set of solutes that best fits experimental data. Each analysis run proceeds over a defined set of curves in s and f/f0 space. The single analysis pass produces the model whose associated simulation differs the least from the experimental data, as determined by its RMSD value. Time-invariant and/or radially-invariant noise(s) may also be computed. The curves in a set cover a specified s and f/f0 range and vary according to a specified increment or count. Each model has a specified number of input solute points along its curve. After an initial pass in which all the specified model curves are evaluated, the results are sorted by fitness (least RMSD). The best model then becomes the starting point for a second pass that utilizes Levenberg-Marquardt to refine the model. The result of that second pass is inserted as the final best model.

Each iteration after the first starts with a range of par1 and par2 values of f/f0 values that is refined from the best models of the previous iteration. Threshold Delta-RMSD Ratio Specify the ratio of the delta in RMSD to previous iteration RMSD that is the threshold below which the iterative scan is taken to have converged. Curve Resolution Points Specify the number of points to generate for each test time. This is the number of solute points that each model will have. Maximum L-M Evaluate Calls Specify the maximum number of Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) evaluate cells to allow. The default of 100 is almost always sufficient. This value is used to insure that a run-away condition will not occur. Additionally, a value of 0 may be specified to suppress L-M and use the final fixed grid best model as the overall best model.
